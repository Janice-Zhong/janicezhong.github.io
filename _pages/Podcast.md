Welcome! You're now reading the full chronicle of a top-tier socially anxious person trying to improve their speaking skills. Here's what you can expect to find here:

🌟 Summaries of research papers in cognitive science / neuroscience / psychology<br>
🌟 Book / movie / TV series / music recommendations<br>
🌟 Summaries of public dialogues and conversations<br>
🌟 A mysterious section (still a secret because I'm not sure I can actually pull it off)<br>
🌟......<br>

_**My dream is to be someone who can randomly and effortlessly talk to anyone for an hour or two, anytime, anywhere 👊**_

It’s all in Chinese for now, but I’m planning to do some English episodes!<br>
Feel free to message me if you’d like to chat or collaborate on an episode!<br>

Meanwhile, I'm very interested in learning languages. I can speak a little French, and I've also learned a bit of German, Sanskrit, and Latin before. <br>
**Don't hesitate to chat with me and share a bit of your language and culture!**
