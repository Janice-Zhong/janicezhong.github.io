Hi! I am Janice, a first-year Ph.D. student at Virginia Tech, working with [Prof. Seongmin A. Park](https://support.psyc.vt.edu/users/spk) in the [Computational Cognitive Neuroscience Lab (CCNL)](http://ccnvt.github.io). Before joining here, I received my B.E. Degree in Biomedical Engineering and B.A. Degree in French from Shanghai Jiaotong University. I also had an internship (summer 2024) with [Prof. Arkady Konovalov](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/psychology/konovalov-arkady) and [Prof. Patricia Lockwood](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/psychology/lockwood-patricia) in the school of Psychology at University of Birmingham.



My research focuses on the cognitive and neural mechanisms of adaptive behavior, with particular interest in learning, abstraction, and generalization.

Outside of research, I enjoy reading, runing and music.<br>
I also host a podcast called [Everything in My 20s](https://podcasts.apple.com/cn/podcast/everything-in-my-20s/id1748741517), where I share my thoughts and feelings. You could find more details at: [My Podcast](/podcast/).
Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat or collaborate on an episode!
